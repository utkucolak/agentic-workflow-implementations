Worker Agent Response:
As a customer support representative, I want the Email Router system to automatically generate responses for routine inquiries, reducing my workload and allowing me to focus on resolving complex issues effectively.

As a subject matter expert (SME), I expect the Email Router system to accurately route only relevant and complex inquiries to me, improving my efficiency and job satisfaction by eliminating unnecessary emails.

As an IT administrator, I need the Email Router system to offer a comprehensive dashboard displaying performance metrics such as response times and accuracy, enabling me to monitor system performance and make necessary adjustments for optimal operation.
 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No, the answer does not meet the criteria. The response provided does not follow the exact structure of user stories required for evaluation.
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
To fix the answer, ensure that it follows the exact structure of user stories required for evaluation. A user story typically consists of three main components: the role or persona, the action or need, and the goal or benefit. Make sure that the response includes these components in a clear and concise manner. Additionally, ensure that the user story is written from the perspective of the user or customer to clearly define their needs and expectations.
