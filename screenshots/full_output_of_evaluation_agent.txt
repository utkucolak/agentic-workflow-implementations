Instructions to fix:
To fix the incorrect answer, you can provide the following feedback to the worker agent:

1. The answer "London" is correct in terms of being a single word that meets the criteria of being solely the name of a city. However, it is important to note that the question may have required a complete sentence as the response. Please ensure that the answer provided aligns with the specific requirements of the question.

2. While "London" is indeed the name of a city and meets the criteria of not being a sentence, it is essential to consider if the question explicitly asked for a single word response or if a complete sentence was required. Make sure to carefully read and understand the question before providing an answer.

3. The answer "London" is valid as it is solely the name of a city and not a sentence. However, it is crucial to verify if the question called for a one-word response or if a sentence was expected. Always double-check the question requirements to ensure the answer provided is appropriate.
